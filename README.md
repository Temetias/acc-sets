# acc-sets
My public Assetto Corsa Competizione setups

## File format
Example:
`3 1.8.18 Q 23c.json`
Where:
`[grade] [patch] [session] [temp ambient].json`

### Explanation of `grade`
Grade indicates a rough estimate of the quality of the set:
- `0`: Mostly only pressures fixed and that's it. Literally aggro preset stuff
- `1`: Usually includes some basic aero and mechanical changes but overall not refined
- `2`: Can be considered a "complete" set but often needs verification / has some parts that are work in progress
- `3`: A set that has been proven and is considered complete. These are sets that I've likely ran in a league environment

## Ownership
These are public for a reason. You can use them, modify them and do whatever. Just don't go and be "that guy" who claims the sets are theirs and posts them behind a paywall.

Also, it's always nice to get feedback :)
